In areas without comprehensive recording of births and deaths, survey based methods are often used to estimate individuals' causes of death and the overall fraction of deaths by cause in a populaton.  openVA is a suite of [R](http://www.r-project.org) packages that implements multiple existing algorithms for coding cause of death from verbal autopsies. It also provides tools for data manipulation tasks commonly used in Verbal Autopsy analysis and implements easy graphical visualization of individual and population level statistics.
