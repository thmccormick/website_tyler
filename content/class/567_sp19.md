### Course components & grading

Approx 5 HWs | 40
In-class presentation| 15
Final project & poster|45

**In-class presentation:**
In weeks 3-9, Tuesday lectures will present statistical methods and Thursday lectures will be student presentations of social science papers that use the method.  Presentations will be in small groups and be approx 20 minutes. 

**Final project:**
Final group project, more details to come.  If you have data from your own research, you're welcome to use it.


**Lab:**
Hands on practice with network data.  Labs count as part of homeworks. 


**Collaborative work:** Working together is highly encouraged!  Each student must, however, turn in their own homework using Github (see below).  Writing must be your own, or appropriately cited.  

**Policies:**

+ Only assignments turned in through [Github](https://github.com/) will count for credit. More info below.  
+ All empirical assignments must also include code.  More info below.
+ Late assignments accepted with at 10% per day penalty. 

**In-class:** I highly discourage the use of laptops during lecture, as I find them very distracting for me and for other students.  If you need to use your phone or are otherwise feeling distracted, please step outside. 


**Submitting code:**

+ You must sign up for a Github account.  I recommend applying for an [educational discount](https://education.github.com/).  All assignments must be submitted through Github.
+ Your code should stand alone.  More information [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
+ I suggest following the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide.

**Academic accommodations:**
To request academic accommodations due to disability, please contact Disabled Student Services, 448 Schmitz Hall, (206) 543-8924.  Myself and your TA will be happy to provide academic accommodations if you have a letter requesting such from Disability Resources for Students (DRS).  Please feel free to see me during office hours to discuss this.

**Related courses:** There are many great social network methods courses.  This course is inspired by a few of them, including Matthew Salganik's [Soc 596](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/soc596_sp08.shtml) at Princeton; James Moody's [Seminar on Social Networks](http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/s884/syllabus_s15.pdf) at Duke; and previous UW versions of this course taught by, among others, Peter Hoff & 
Miruna Petrescu-Prahova.
