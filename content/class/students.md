I'm eager to work with student and postdoctoral collaborators! Thanks for your interest!  If you have further questions after checking out the information below please send me a message.
<br>
<br>
## Undergraduate, Masters, and visiting students
The first step in the process is to take a look around my website to see the kind of work I do and see what you find interesting.  Once you've done that, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZLbfNFG2tADlTe9nbLMB8f4HmBKJ-aWEfWyAZXP-n0FAfAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Please note that availability of positions changes frequently, so when I have a position available I will contact individuals based on interests expressed in the form.  
<br>
<br>
## Doctoral students
Admissions to the PhD program is coordinated through a central committee, so I unfortunately can't provide any information about the likelihood of a particular student being admitted.  We also don't admit students directly to research groups/labs, so you'll need to be admitted through the department's admission process. If you have specific questions about the admission process or the program requirements at UW please contact the Director of Graduate Studies (information available on the department homepage).  If you have questions related to my work or you're already admitted to the UW program, please send me an email!
<br>
<br>
## Postdoctoral collaborators
Please get in touch to find out if there are opportunities available.  Typically if I have a position available there will be an advertisement on statistics jobs boards such as the [University of Florida](https://forms.stat.ufl.edu/statistics-jobs/) or the [ISBA jobs board](https://bayesian.org/resources/jobs/).
