I'm eager to work with student and postdoctoral collaborators! Thanks for your interest!  If you don't see what you're looking for here please get in touch.
<br>
<br>
## Undergraduate, Masters, and visiting students
The first step in the process is to take a look around my website to see the kind of work I do and see what you find interesting.  Once you've done that, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZLbfNFG2tADlTe9nbLMB8f4HmBKJ-aWEfWyAZXP-n0FAfAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to get in touch.  Please note that availability of positions changes frequently, so when I have a position available I will get in touch with individuals based on interests expressed in the form.  I regret that I'm typically not able to answer individual queries over email.  
<br>
<br>
## Doctoral students
Admissions to the PhD program is coordinated through a central committee.  I'm excited to work with motivated students in many different areas, but students must first be admitted to the PhD program.  If you have specific questions about the admission process please contact the Director of Graduate Studies (information available on the department homepage).  If you're already admitted to the UW program, please send me an email!
<br>
<br>
## Postdoctoral collaborators
Please get in touch to find out if there are opportunities available.  Typically if I have a position available there will be an advertisement on statistics jobs boards such as the [University of Florida](https://forms.stat.ufl.edu/statistics-jobs/) or the [ISBA jobs board](https://bayesian.org/resources/jobs/).
